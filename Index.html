<h3><em>Here are some things you may not know about me.</em></h3>
<ul>
    <li>I love video games I have been playing them since I could hold a controller.</li>
    <li>I love to dance. I created a dance crew in middle school and we would go around battling other schools.</li>
    <li>I wanted to play basketball when I was young but I want to be like the And1 player Hot Sauce. long story short I did some moves that did not end well.
</li>
<li>I broke my ankle back in 2012 so bad the only reason I still had it connected was cause of my skin on my foot</li>
<li>I have been attacked by two rattlesnakes, a mountain lion, 12 people in my life</li>
<li>My dream car is a 1965 chevy camaro and add neon lights and hydraulics</li>
